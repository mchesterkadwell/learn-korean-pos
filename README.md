# Proof-of-concept: tagging text for Korean language learners

When beginning to learn the Korean language, it is sometimes hard to tell which parts of words are grammatical particles 
and which parts are substantive root words you could look up in the dictionary.

This project aims to make it easier for Korean language learners to decode written Korean sentences, by marking up 
particles and other grammatical parts, and giving some basic word-level translation. It is not intended to be 
a translation tool, as such, because it does not emphasise a sentence-level contextual translation. Rather, it is 
supposed to help with learning how to decode sentences for yourself.

***NB: This is a work in progress!***
